# C Bucket Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a template implementation of the Bucket Sort algorithm in the C programming language. Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that distributes elements of an array into a finite number of buckets and then applies a sorting algorithm to each bucket independently. It is particularly useful when the input data is uniformly distributed.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BucketSort_C-Lang.git
   cd BucketSort_C-Lang
   ```

2. **Compile and run the program:**
   ```
   gcc BucketSort.c -o bucket_sort
   ./bucket_sort
   ```

3. **Testing:**
   Modify the `main` function in `BucketSort.c` to test the algorithm on your custom input arrays.

## Bucket Sort Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

// Function to find the maximum element in the array
int MaxElement(int array[], int size) {
    // Implementation of finding the maximum element in the array
}

// Function to perform Bucket Sort
void BucketSort(int array[], int size) {
    // Implementation of the Bucket Sort algorithm
}
```

## Performance

Bucket Sort has an average-case time complexity of O(n + k), where n is the number of elements to be sorted, and k is the number of buckets used. It performs well when the input data is uniformly distributed over a range of values.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the algorithm's efficiency, extend the implementation, or add more test cases are welcome! Please create a pull request, and we'll be glad to review it.
